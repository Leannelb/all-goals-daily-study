### Nouns
#### countable: city cat
- plural with s: cities cats
#### uncountable nouns:
- abstract or collective: happiness, information, vocabulary, furnature

Verbs: Verbs are categorised as ‘action’ verbs (e.g., ‘read’; ‘study’) or being (or ‘linking’) verbs, which also encompass ‘feeling’ (e.g., ‘be’; ‘feel’). Verbs are conjugated (e.g., ‘I eat’; ‘He eats’); they can be transitive that is, taking a direct object (‘He throws the ball); or they can be intransitive, where there is never an object (‘I live in Edinburgh’). Depending on the context, some verbs can be both.

Adjectives: These describe nouns and pronouns (‘I own a red car’); adjectives can also be complements (coming after a being verb, as in ‘He is tall’). When two nouns are placed together, the first one functions as an adjective, as in ‘hair care products’ or ‘learner groups’. In such cases, the noun that functions as the adjective can never be rendered in plural form (e.g., as in ‘learners groups’.)

Adverbs: Adverbs have several elements. They are often used as adverbials, providing information about, for example, time, manner and place:

Time: soon, already, still
Manner: easily, fast slowly
Place: here, away, somewhere
They can also be used as modifiers (any word that affects the meaning of other words. They can modify verbs:

He speaks fast.

They can modify adjectives and thus form adjective phrases:

You are terribly wrong.

That was very easy.

They can modify other adverbs to make adverb phrases:

He speaks quite fast.

Adverbs can also function as transition phrases (Consequently, he had to move to London).

We all learned that adverbs end in –ly, but also remember those other non adverb-like endings such as ‘-wise’, as in ‘clockwise’. Also, all words that end in ‘-ly’ are not adverbs. Take the words ‘lovely’ and ‘weekly’: these are adjectives since the root word form, ‘love’ and ‘week’, are nouns; adding -ly makes them adjectives.

Conjunctions: Conjunctions (‘but’, ‘and’, ‘yet’, ‘or’,’ so’) join words, phrases, and clauses. Such conjunctions are referred to as coordinating conjunctions, and are frequently used to join two independent clauses. For example: I studied hard for the test, but still failed. Another category is the subordinating conjunction; subordinating conjunctions are used to connect dependent clauses to independent clauses (or other dependent clauses). For example: I passed the test even though I didn’t study.

Determiners: These are words that ‘determine’ the nouns that follow them. For example, articles are determiners (The cat is drinking the milk). In this case, ‘the’ as a determiner tells us that the cat is specific, defined. Possessive adjectives (not to be confused with possessive pronouns), such as ‘my’, ‘your, ‘his’ are also determiners. Essentially, anything that serves to quantify a noun is a determiner.

Prepositions: These are typically paired with nouns to form prepositional phrases. For example: The book is on the table. Prepositions give students lots of problems, particularly when they are linked to more than one preposition, as in ‘out of’ and ‘in spite of.’

Pronouns: Pronouns replace nouns or noun phrases and, similar to nouns, function as subject, object, object of a preposition, or complement. Pronouns have different categories:

a) subject pronouns (‘I’, ‘he’, ‘we’)

b) object pronouns (‘me’, ‘him’, ‘us’)

c) demonstrative pronouns (‘this’, ‘that’, ‘these’, ‘those’)

d) possessive pronouns (‘his’, ‘hers’, ‘ours’, ‘theirs’)

e) reflexive pronouns: (‘myself’, ‘yourself’, ‘himself’, ‘ourselves’).

Conditional forms

When something is conditional, that means it is dependent on something else that is only imagined in order to occur. For example:

If I were a rich man, I would give most of my money to charity.

We usually begin conditions with ‘if’.

Conditions can be categorised as real and unreal.

Real conditions

We do not know if the condition is, will be or was true. Here are some examples:

If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay in.
If Lisa is coming to the party, you can tell her the news.
I’m sure she'll come if John has remembered to tell her.
Note: We cannot use will for future time in a condition:

We say If it rains tomorrow Not If it will rain

We say If she's coming Not If she will be coming

We sometimes use unless (if . . . not) at the beginning of a condition:

Unless it rains tomorrow, I'll go to the beach.

Unless she's in England, I'm sure she'll come.

I'm sure she'll come unless John has forgotten to tell her about it.

Unreal conditions

For present and future time the condition is not, or probably will not be, true. We use a simple or continuous verb formation.

If Maria was coming, you could tell her the news. (But she isn't coming; you can't tell her.)

I would have more money if I didn't smoke. (But I smoke; I have less money.)

I'd phone him if only I could find his number. (But I can't find it; I can't phone him.)

If I found a lot of money in the road, I'd give it to the police.  (I don't expect to find any; I'm imagining.)

Note this construction: Would you mind if I left early?

Would + mind + unreal condition is a polite way to ask for permission.

For Past Time (the condition was not true), we use a perfect verb formation in the condition:

If Maria had come, you could have told her the news. (But she didn't come; you couldn't tell her.)

I'd have phoned him if only I could have found his number. (But I couldn't find it; I didn't phone.)

If I had found that money, I would have given it to the police. (I didn't find it; I'm just imagining.)

I'm sure Maria would've come if John hadn't forgotten to tell her. (But John forgot; she didn't come.)

Note:  Conditions can go before the basic sentence, If it's fine, I'll go to the beach, or after it, I'll go to the beach if it's fine. If we put the condition before the basic sentence, we use a comma.

Phrases-noun and verb

A phrase is a word or small group of words that forms a meaningful unit within a sentence. Two important types are the noun phrase and the verb phrase.

Noun phrase

The noun phrase can be a word or group of words based on a noun or pronoun that can function in a sentence as a subject, object or prepositional object; it can be very simple or very complex. A noun phrase is built around a single noun or pronoun, for example:

A vase of roses stood on the table.

She was reading a book about the history of France.

Verb phrase

In grammar, a verb phrase is a verb of more than one word. It includes one or more helping (or auxiliary) verbs and one main verb:

can see (helping verb can + main verb see)
would have sent (helping verbs would + have + main verb send)
may have been planning  (helping verbs may + have + be + main verb plan)

The main verb expresses the chief idea in the verb phrase. The other verbs are there only to help it.

The main verb is always the last verb in the phrase. Often its form changes, as in the last two examples, in which send becomes sent and plan becomes planning.

Modals

Modal verbs are used in a variety of ways to enable the speaker to express feelings about, for example, the probability of an event, or the ability of a person to carry out a certain action or the level of an obligation – but not the actuality of it happening.

Other uses of modals are to express one’s attitude, politeness, or advice; modals are also used for making requests or giving permission.

The verbs in this category, although there are conflicting views on this, are can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, must, have to, ought to and used to.

Modals are quite challenging for teachers to present to students, both conceptually and formally.

Examples:

The following context shows the least probability:

Bill: Somebody is at the door.

Ben: It could be Mum.

Now, look at the range of probability expressed through the use of different modals:









 

You will find that using this kind of illustration can greatly help in your explaining the meanings of sentences using modals.

Main parts of a sentence

Remember that grammar can be defined as the arrangement of different units of language into meaningful sentences. What exactly are these units of language?

The sentence is a set of words standing on their own as a “sense” unit, its conclusion marked by a full stop or equivalent (question mark; exclamation mark). In English, of course, sentences begin with a capital letter and include a verb. There is no minimum number of words a sentence must contain in order to be a sentence. Again, the only pre-requisite is a main subject and a main verb. For example, I exist is as much of a sentence is The early bird catches the worm.

The clause is kind of a mini-sentence: a set of words which makes a sense unit, but may not be concluded by a full stop. A sentence may consist of two or more clauses, e.g. She left (1) because it was late (2) and she was tired (3); this sentence contains three clauses. A clause is a group of related words containing a subject and a verb. 

The phrase is a shorter unit within the clause, of one or more words, but fulfils the same sort of function as a single word. A verb phrase, for example, functions the same way as a single word verb (e.g. was going); a noun phrase like a one-word noun or pronoun (e.g. a long table).

The word is the minimum normally separable form: in writing, it appears as a stretch of letters with a space on either side.

The morpheme is a part of a word which can be perceived as a distinct component. Within the word passed, for example, are the two morphemes pass, and –ed. A word may consist of a single morpheme (e.g. book).

Subject

The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is doing or being something. You can find the subject of a sentence if you can find the verb. For instance, in the sentence The computers in the Learning Centre must be replaced, the verb is must be replaced. What must be replaced? The computers. So the subject is computers.

A simple subject is the subject of a sentence stripped of modifiers. The simple subject of the following sentence is issue:

The really important issue of the conference, stripped of all other considerations, is the morality of the nation.

Sometimes, though, a simple subject can be more than one word, even an entire clause. In the following sentence —

What he had already forgotten about computer repair could fill whole volume,

The simple subject is not computer repair, nor is it what he had forgotten, nor is it he. Ask what it is that could fill whole volumes. Your answer should be that the entire underlined clause is the simple subject.
