- first 30 minutes had an error on .find not sure what is going on.

## 68
- REDUX state management - action creator - a thunk function calls a function in a function.

## 
- clearing the cart after we have sent the order to the server.
- Redux and when to use it (managing state in large applications).

# Day 65 *said the wrong day.
## Link redux videos, remove me chatting about wrong project


## 64

- MENTION - Update required when video is complete for the users ability to circumnavagate the UI validation when submitting to the server - hense server side valadtion is a must!

## D 63
- creating a checkout file
- using checkout.module.css files to import our styles into our React component.
- creating a checkout form to take in the users name and address for the order
- adding dynamic validation to the checkout input feilds and conditionally showing the checkout area only if there are items in the cart & we want to order them (select the order button)
- using props that have been passed into the checkout component.
- Using Reacts useRef() hook to link back up the data to the input

## Day 58

of #100daysofcode. Today I'm building out the meals application, using createPortal and useContext see below:

1. createPortal to create a modal in react
2. useContext to manage the state of the cart across the application.
3. click handlers to handle what will happen when an item is clicked
4. Handling passing of props from component to component

## Day 61

Adding items to our cart with clickHandlers
Adding add and remove methods to add and remove items from the cart
Fixing errors
Using reacts built in use context
adding animation on the cart button when we add an item to the cart - exciting!

Day 57
Building out meals application & retrieved the meals from the Firebase backend
Motivation & chit chat - good ol' Lillys back at it again, I love the chat's with you guys!
We also discussed 1. useEffect 2. Asynchronous functions 3. Errors & error handling 4. Try & catch blocks

Day 56
Following maxes tutorial

- trying to connect to a firebase backend to pull our meals from a database instead of hard coding dummy data into our applicaton
- by the end of the video we resolved the bug - it was pretty simple in the end but did take the hour to find it.
- a simple incorrect call to the api caused all the errors we were seeing.

Day 55
Following maxes tutorial again to continue to impment our custom hook we made for form valadation

- tried to connect to a firebase backend to pull our meals from a database instead of hard coding dummy data into our applicaton

### Day 54

- back to maxes course
- implemented form validation with change handlers and useState to check the validity of a form
- lots going on in the form component, so we extracted the validation logic of inputs to it's own custom hook to be used wherever we want in the app
- got this approach working.

## Day 53

- Lilly, Alphonzo and Nana finish Nanas course
- Today we looked at Helm Kubernetes package manager for keeping your yaml files batched together for easy use by many users.
- We seen how to manage storage with Kubernetes
- both continuous for deployment and stateful storage
  & we finished Nana's Kubernetes course, thank you nana we learned a lot!
