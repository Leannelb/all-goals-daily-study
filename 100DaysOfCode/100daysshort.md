# D35 - REDUX STORE & REACT

# D38 - REACT, LOADING, ASYNC
Got data back from an API. 
Added a loading message to display when we were waiting for the data. 
Did error handling of a failed request using a try catch block 
Requested the data from the server in an asynchronous fashion, using async and await.

## D39 - REACT, FIREBASE BACKEND

Saved data to the database (POST) & fetched (GET) this data from a backend - Firebase a free online database you can use.

## D43 - REACT - FORMS & BUG FIXES

## D44 - REACT - FORMS & BUG FIXES | DAY 44
Today we are looking at Forms and form validation in React, thank you for joining me yet again on day 44 for some form validation, general chit chat & encouragement today, checking the documentation & implementing validation. 

## D45 - KUBERNETES - K8s DEPLOYMENT  

## D46 KUBERNETES - K8s

## D47 - KUBERNETES | IMPROVED VIDEO QUALITY | DAY 47
In todays video were are continuing with TechWorld With Nana Kubernetes tutorial:

minikube status
kubectl version
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pod

## D48 - KUBERNETES - K8s - CONFIG FILES 
Today we continued with Kubernetes & covered the following:
- set up
- config
- namespaces

## D49 - CHIT CHAT & KUBERNETES 
Today we continued with Kubernetes &  I was in a pretty chatty mood today so was enjoying having chats with you guys. 
On todays video I'm chatting about:
- Loving yourself
- General encouragement
- Do something small for yourself
- Live from the heart
- Have a cuppa tea
- Be kind

In a coding sense we looked at: 
Kuberenetes configuration files hahahaha

## D50 - KUBERNETES ERRORS - NOT SOLVED 
Today we continued with Kubernetes &  I had a lot of errors, I couldn't create my secret file in order to then deploy my kubernetes. So was a non-progress day in a way but check it out if you so wish :) Thanks.

## D51 - KUBERNETES WATCHING NANA  
Today we continued with Kubernetes. I had a good few errors yesterday so I'm just watching Nanas video now and following along. Guinness at the ready!
## D52 - KUBERNETES WATCHING NANA 
Today we continued with Kubernetes. Just watching Nanas video now and following along.

## D53 - KUBERNETES FINAL DAY WITH NANA 
- Lilly, Alphonzo and Nana finish Nanas course
- Today we looked at Helm Kubernetes package manager for keeping your yaml files batched together for easy use by many users.
- We seen how to manage storage with Kubernetes
- both continuous for deployment and stateful storage
 & we finished Nana's Kubernetes course, thank you nana we learned a lot!

  ## D54 - CUSTOM REACT HOOKS & FORM VALIDATION
On day 54 guys we are going back to Maximilian's Complete React tutorial after a detour to learn some Kubernetes.
& we did the following: 
- Implemented form validation with change handlers and useState to check the validity of a form
- There was a lot going on in the form component, so we extracted the validation of the form inputs to it's own custom hook to be used wherever we want in the app.
- got this approach working.


## D55 - CUSTOM REACT HOOKS & FIREBASE DATA 
Following maxes tutorial again to continue to impment our custom hook we made for form valadation
- tried to connect to a firebase backend to pull our meals from a database instead of hard coding dummy data into our applicaton


## D56 - RETRIEVING FIREBASE DATA & ERRORS
Following maxes tutorial
- trying to connect to a firebase back-end to pull our meals from a database instead of hard coding dummy data into our application.
- by the end of the video we resolved the bug - it was pretty simple in the end but did take the hour to find it.
- a simple incorrect call to the API caused all the errors we were seeing.

## D57 - FIREBASE DATA & ERRORS - TRY & CATCH
Following maxes tutorial & what I did today was: 
- Building out meals application & retrieved the meals from the Firebase backend
- Motivation & chit chat - good ol' Lillys back at it again, I love the chat's with you guys! You are loved guys, I love you.
- We also discussed 
1. useEffect 
2. Asynchronous functions 
3. Errors & error handling 
4. Try & catch blocks


## D58 - REACT CREATEPORTAL & USECONTEXT STATE
Day 58 today of #100daysofcode. Today I'm building out the meals application, using createPortal and useContext see below:
1. createPortal to create a modal in react
2. useContext to manage the state of the cart across the application.
3. click handlers to handle what will happen when an item is clicked
4. Handling passing of props from component to component

## D59 - REACT CLICK HANDLERS, useREDUCER & ERRORS
Day 59 today of #100daysofcode. Today I'm building out the meals application, see below:
1. Creating click handlers to run functions on click of a button within a react JSX statement.
2. useReducer to add an action type of 'ADD' and 'REMOVE' to handle adding and removing items to the cart. The useReducer manages the state & performs a function (add/remove etc.)
3. Solving errors, again a lot of the time some errors are caused by very small incorrect code implementation
4. Using toFixed() to get a 2 decimal place value for our price! 

## D60 - REACT SHOPPING CART 
Today we are looking at:
-  Building a list of items in a shopping cart for our meal ordering application. We created a custom component for this a CartItem component
- concat (concatenation) used to add an item to the end of the array storing the cart items. If we already have this item - we've added some logic to handle this and increment the amount in the cart instead.
- Creating functions to handle the addition of an item to the cart and removal of an item from the cart

## D61 - REACT TRIM() & useEFFECT() HOOK
Today is day 61 of #100daysofcode
- Continuing to build out our meals application. We are now successfully adding items to the cart. the trim() inbuilt function needs to be executed.. with the parenthesis after the word trim! () I accidentally left it out yesterday causing errors.
- Encouragement for the learning process guys!
- Using Reactjs inbuilt hook - useEffect to allow the button animation to 'pop' when we add an item to the cart
- Looking at the browsers dev tools & taking about Reactjs and then the role of ReactDOM too (to put the react items into the DOM)

## D62 - REACT COMPONENT RENDERING & TOGGLE VIEW 
Lilly & Pickle Ricckkk!!!! Are coding today, welcome!
What we covered:
- showing and hiding a paragraph by toggling the display on and off.
- Looking at how conditionally showing and hiding items interacts with the DOM 
- When are React components re-rendered? We look into this.
- How to add import statements to your files and access other file paths
- Singing silly songs

## D63 - REACT CHECKOUT COMPONENT | useREF() & PROPS
Day 63 today:
- creating a checkout file
- using checkout.module.css files to import our styles into our React component.
- creating a checkout form to take in the users name and address for the order
- adding dynamic validation to the checkout input feilds and conditionally showing the checkout area only if there are items in the cart & we want to order them (select the order button)
- using props that have been passed into the checkout component.
- using Reacts useRef() hook to link back up the data to the input

## D64 - REACT FORM VALIDATION | useSTATE() | CONDITIONAL CSS
1. A quick look at the React useState documentation
2. Form submission & validation with Reacts useState() hook (by tracking the state of an object we define)
2. Accessing the properties of an object
3. Form inputs, validating them, adding error messages to the inputs
4. Conditionally showing CSS classes if the form input is valid/invalid (so if the form input is invalid, make the input red, if not don't show this)
5. Using HTTP Fetch to POST data to the backend
6. Functions to handle on click events - our submitOrderHandler()
7. Lot's of general chitchat & singing as always.
